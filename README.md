How to play

2. Simon will duplicate the first signal and add one. Repeat these two signals by pressing the same color lenses, in order.

3. Simon will duplicate these first two signals and add one.

4. Continue playing as long as you can repeat each sequence of signals correctly.

5. If you fail to repeat a sequence exactly, Simon responds with a "BUZZ" sound. This means you've lost, and the sequence of signals ends.

6. Press any key if you want to try again.
